### Repository Purpose

This GitHub repo was built to store my answers for the two mini-projects in STAT545 for the fall of 2023. Answers are stored in their respective folders, named  a file named "Milestone 1" and "Milestone 2" respectively". For each assignment, I drafted the answers first in a R markdown file, which is named "Mini-Project-1.Rmd" or "Mini-Project-2.Rmd" depending on the assignment, then knit that markdown to create the other ".md" file.

### Engaging with this Repo

I created a R project file called 'mda-Sebastian-Santana-Ort.Rproj'. It allowed me to shift my working directory in R and let me see the Git window on RStudio. I recommend that anyone trying to replicate my work opens it first. Once the ".Rproj" file is open, then open the Milestone folder of interest, open the ".Rmd" file which contains all the code I used for my answers (all necessary packages are loaded in the beginning). Lastly, once the .Rmd file is open, the file can be 'knit' into an ".md" file.
