### Repository Purpose

This GitHub repo was built to store my answers for the first mini-project in STAT545 for the fall of 2023. The answers are stored in a file named 'Mini Project 1.md'. I drafted the answers first in a R markdown file, which is named 'Mini Project 1.Rmd' then knit that markdown to create the .md file.

### Engaging with this Repo

I created a R project file called 'mda-Sebastian-Santana-Ort.Rproj'. It allowed me to shift my working directory in R and let me see the Git window on RStudio. I recommend that anyone trying to replicate my work opens it first. Once the project file is open, then open the 'Mini Project 1.Rmd'. That is a R markdown file which contains all the code I used for my answers (all necessary packages are loaded in the beginning). Lastly, once the .Rmd file is open, the file can be 'knit' into a .md file.
